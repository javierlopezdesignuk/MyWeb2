                services, sales, carts, checkouts, etc. Some meetings were needed to set the users profiles, sitemap and 
                get the brand style approbed to start with wireframes and prototypes.

    $conclusion = "This project has been quite challenging, working with a timer as the business needed to be online as soon as possible with all the features and a tested checkout to give her customers an easy way to pay and enjoy her food.
    <br>
    I learnt that I should develop the CMS in the first instance and I would save a lot of time with the site's copy, in that way the copywriter could work on his way applying SEO with no disruptions to the rest of the development, that cost to the project an unespected week in the scope. 
    Overall I've enjoyed this project developing and reasearching different kinds of checkouts. Applied Google Maps API sorted out a huge issue figuring out the delivery fees.";
